We implemented a virtual CT (specifically part of the colon) to detect abnormalities, such as benign tumor (polyps) and/or cancerous tumor; the algorithms were developed using python. Furthermore, the algorithm would essentially imitate the performance of a CT scanner in various orientations. 
We created a system that collects numerous projections along different orientations upon image slicing. It would consist of our code slicing the phantom image diagonally, horizontally, and vertically.

### Instructions on how to run the code:
1) Press the run button.
2) Enter a x value for the tumor to be placed (100 < x < 150) any number not between the tumor will not be inside the colon.
3) Enter a y value for the tumor to be placed (100 < y < 150) any number not between the tumor will not be inside the colon.
4) Enter a slice type, "vertical", "horizontal", or "diagonal" anything else will be an invalid slice type.
5) Enter the number of slices, a integer value 1-255 anything else will be too few cuts or too many cuts.

### Process while running the code:
1) Firstly, will display an image of the orginal phantom with the colon.
2) Secondly, then will ask for standard input and standard output (STDIN).
3) Thirdly, it will then create amount of the images wanted to be sliced.
4) Lastly, it will display the image that have been cut and put it back together.
