We implemented a virtual CT (specifically part of the colon) to detect abnormalities, such as benign tumor (polyps) and/or cancerous tumor; the algorithms were developed using python. Furthermore, the algorithm would essentially imitate the performance of a CT scanner in various orientations. We created a system that collects numerous projections along different orientations upon image slicing. It would consist of our code slicing the phantom image diagonally, horizontally, and vertically.
